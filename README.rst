    `Un inventaire`_ √† la Pr√©vert

You're gathering things. Topics. Ideas. Images. And one ü¶ù.

And then you're gathering *moar* things. Books. Quotes. Web sites. And two ü¶ù.

And then you're drawing paths. This idea refers to that book. That book is
written by this person. This person is your friend. Three ü¶ù, that makes a small
society!

And *moar* things, and *moar* paths, thus listing what you need to create your
world. Yet another ü¶ù.

Finally, follow the trails, beginning everywhere, going in all available
directions. Meeting many, many ü¶ù.
