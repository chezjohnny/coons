    <h2>What is {{_(config.THEME_SITENAME)}}?</h2>
    <p>
    You're gathering things. Topics. Ideas. Images. And one ü¶ù.
    </p>
    <p>
    And then you're gathering <em>moar</em>* things. Books. Quotes. Web sites.
    And two ü¶ù.
    </p>
    <p>
    And then you're drawing paths. This idea refers to that book. That book is
    written by this person. This person is your friend. Three ü¶ù, that makes a
    small society!
    </p>
    <p>
    And <em>moar</em> things, and <em>moar</em>* paths, thus listing what you
    need to create your world. Yet another ü¶ù.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, follow the trails, beginning everywhere, going in all available
    directions. Meeting many, many ü¶ù.
